# Word Count
Three different ways to perform word counting in a text file. All programs run in Colab environment. 
- Python - Demonstrate the basic Python programing skills - low-level programming (for loop)
- Pandas - Demonstrate the Pandas data analysis features - high-level functions
- Apache Spark - Demonstrate the concept of big data analytics - Functional programming paradigm

We start with a very simple data source is used which contains only two lines: "To be or" and "not to be". 

The concept of word counting can be simply explained using the following illustration:

This illustration also helps when we deal with big data analytics using the concept of Map and Reduce. This illustration is from the following Spark Workshop:
